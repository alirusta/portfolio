# Portfolio - PLEASE VIEW WITH FIREFOX, AS CHROME FOR SOME REASON IGNORES THE BACKDROP BLUR FOR MY CARD-CONTAINER!
 # Directions and Layouts:
 ## Fonts:
- **Montserrat** for headers and titles.
- **Roboto** for everything else.
- **Condiment** as logo.
- **Comfortaa** for nav- and form-elements. 
## Layout:
### Mobile:
- One column, everything vertically-centered.
- Collapsed nav-bar.
 ### Desktop:
- Widen everything horizontally. Except form-page, leave as is.
- Three columns for projects, which collapses into two columns for tablet and one for mobile.
# General Ideas:
## GLASSMORPHISM WITH COLORFUL GRADIENT-BGs ON ALL PAGES
### ANIMATIONS MUST BE COHERENT WITH DESIGN AND LAYOUT
### SHOULD NOT DIFFER TOO MUCH FROM ANOTHER AS THAT WOULD BREAK THE COHESIVE OVERALL DEISGN
 ### Landing Page:
- Animations and color gradients for eye-candy and aesthetics. Brief introduction of myself and my skills.
- Effects on the summary text and name for further eye-candy purposes.
### Colors:
- Nothing too bright to hurt the eyes. A gradient loop perhaps?
### About me Page:
- Timeline without a "line"
- Rough summary of my experiences and works so far.
- Fluid animation upon entry on page.

### My projects Page:
- Three cards with a "veiling" animation, resembling glass covering up the card, blurring everything
- Upon hover the "glass" rolls down and turns into a card-title, reveiling the content behind it.

### Contact me Page:
- Simple contact-form coherently designed in a glassmorphic way.
- Added simple animations for eye-candy and to make the bland page more lively.
