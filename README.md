 # Directions and Layouts:
 ## Fonts:
- **Eagle Lake** to accentuate name.
- **Montserrat** for landing page summary.
- **Roboto** for everything else.
- **Condiment** as logo.
- **Comfortaa** for nav-elements. 
## Layout:
### Mobile:
- One column, everything vertically-centered.
- Collapsed nav-bar.
### Tablet:
- Two columns, One for text, one for iframes of current work.
- Uncollapsed nav-bar.
 ### Desktop:
- Three columns. One for text, two for iframes of current work.
- Wide nav-bar with logo positioned left and nav-elements right.
# General Ideas:
 ## Landing Page:
- Spaceous landing page, creating a feeling of vastness and infinite possibilites for the viewer.
- Animated background purely through code for eye-candy purposes and display of knowledge.
- Effects on the summary text and name for further eye-candy purposes.
### Colors:
- Nothing too bright to hurt the eyes. A gradient loop perhaps? Particles following your cursor?
- Gradient loop inside logo on nav-bar, around the font.
